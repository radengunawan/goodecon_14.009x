1. Returns to Capital
Analogy:
Imagine you are a farmer who owns a piece of land. You decide to plant apple trees on your land. The apples you harvest each year represent the returns on your investment (the land, trees, and your effort). The more fertile your land and the better your farming techniques, the more apples you harvest each year. This increase in apple production is analogous to an increase in the "returns to capital" — your land and trees are your capital, and the apples are the returns.

Quantitative Example:
Suppose you invest $100,000 in a factory that produces widgets. Initially, the factory produces 1,000 widgets per year, and you sell each widget for $20, so your revenue is $20,000 annually. If after some time, technological improvements allow the factory to produce 2,000 widgets without increasing your costs, your revenue doubles to $40,000. The "returns to capital" have increased from $20,000 to $40,000 due to higher productivity.


2. Aggregate and Distributional Effects
Analogy:
Think of a big pizza being shared at a party. 
The "aggregate effect" is the total size of the pizza — how much pizza there is to share. 

The "distributional effect" is how the pizza is divided among the guests. 

If the pizza size increases but is unevenly distributed (some people get much more pizza than others), 
the aggregate effect is positive, but the distributional effect could be seen as unfair.

Quantitative Example:
Imagine a country that adopts a new trade policy, leading to an overall GDP increase 

from $1 trillion to $1.1 trillion (a 10% increase). 

This is the "aggregate effect." 

However, if 80% of this new wealth goes to the top 10% of earners, while 

the remaining 90% of the population sees little to no increase in income, 

the "distributional effect" is skewed, leading to inequality even though the 

total wealth of the country has increased.


3. Gains and Pains from Trade
Analogy:
Consider a scenario where two friends, Alice and Bob, decide to trade toys. 

Alice has lots of action figures but wants some puzzles, 

while 

Bob has puzzles but prefers action figures. 


After the trade, both are happier — these are the "gains from trade." 

However, if Bob’s little brother also loved the puzzles and now has none to play with, 

this would represent the "pains from trade" for someone else affected by the transaction.

Quantitative Example:
Suppose Country A and Country B start trading. 

Country A exports high-tech machinery, 

while 

Country B exports agricultural products. 

Country A's GDP grows from $500 billion to $550 billion (a $50 billion gain), 

and Country B’s GDP grows from $300 billion to $330 billion (a $30 billion gain). 

These are the "gains from trade." 

However, workers in Country B’s small manufacturing sector may lose their jobs due to cheaper imports, 

representing the "pains from trade." 

For instance, if 10,000 workers lose jobs that paid $30,000 per year, 

the "pains from trade" could be seen as a $300 million loss in income for those workers.
