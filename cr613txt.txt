The question asks why we should care about automation and inequality, 
with several possible reasons provided. The selected answers and explanation 
reflect the themes discussed in "Good Economics for Hard Times," a book by Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo. H
ere’s an explanation of the context, both implicitly and explicitly:

### **Explicit Context:**
1. **Automation and Labor Market Disruption:**
   - The first selected answer mentions
 that automation could lead to significant 
disruptions in the labor market.
 This is a key concern, as automation, 
particularly in sectors with high levels 
of routine work, can result in large-scale
 job losses, leading to unemployment
 and shifts in the types of skills 
that are in demand.
  
2. **Automation and Inequality:**
   - The second selected answer points out 
that automation could increase inequality.
 This is a crucial issue because, 
as jobs are replaced by machines, 
income distribution may become more unequal. 
Those who own the capital 
(such as the robots or the technologies) 
benefit more than the workers who may 
lose their jobs.

3. **High Inequality Leading to Social 
Disruptions:**
   - The third selected answer highlights
 that high inequality can lead to social 
disruptions. 
Societies with high inequality 
often face increased social tensions, 
which can manifest in various forms, 
including political instability, 
crime, and 
social unrest.

4. **Fairness and Inequality:**
   - The final selected answer touches 
on the fairness perspective,
 suggesting that many inequalities 
are hard to justify from a fairness 
point of view. This reflects the ethical 
and moral considerations of inequality 
in society, which can lead to a sense 
of injustice and dissatisfaction 
among the populace.

### **Implicit Context:**
1. **Economic Research and 
Misconceptions:**
   - One of the statements that were not
 selected states, "Economic research has 
clearly shown that high inequality makes
 people work harder and is thus desirable
 from an efficiency point of view.
" This is implicitly corrected in 
the explanation, where it's clarified 
that research does not support this claim.
 Instead, high inequality does not 
necessarily lead to increased
 productivity or efficiency, and it 
could even be counterproductive 
by reducing overall welfare.

2. **Automation’s Impact on Wage Share:**
   - The explanation provided at the
 bottom explicitly addresses a point 
made in the book: automation tends to 
reduce the wage share of income because 
robots and machines do not receive wages, 
while capital owners (those who
 own the robots) see their income 
share increase. This shift in income 
distribution further exacerbates 
inequality.

3. **Social Justice 
and 
Policy Implications:**
   - Implicitly, the question is 
probing into broader themes of social justice
 and the role of policy in mitigating 
the negative effects of automation. 
The correct answers suggest a concern for 
the fairness and social consequences of
 unchecked automation and rising inequality, 
which are major themes in the book.

In summary, the problem is exploring the multiple dimensions of 
why automation and inequality are significant
 issues in contemporary economics and public policy,
 with a focus on the potential disruptions to 
the labor market, the exacerbation of
 inequality, and the ethical considerations of 
fairness. The question reflects the nuanced discussion 
in "Good Economics for Hard Times," emphasizing 
the need for careful consideration and 
policy intervention in these areas.
