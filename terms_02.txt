The Stolper-Samuelson Theorem addresses distributional issues by 

explaining how international trade affects the relative earnings of 

different factors of production (capital and labor) within a country. 

Specifically, the theorem predicts that trade benefits the owners of the factor that is 

abundant in a country and harms the owners of the factor that is scarce.

How It Works:

1. Assumption:
   - The theorem assumes two countries: one that is capital-abundant (rich country) and one that is labor-abundant (poor country).
   - Each country specializes in producing goods that intensively use its abundant factor. 
     The rich country specializes in capital-intensive goods, while the poor country specializes in labor-intensive goods.

2. Effect on Factor Prices:
   - When trade occurs, the demand for the abundant factor in each country increases, 
   leading to higher returns for that factor. 
   Conversely, the demand for the scarce factor decreases, leading to lower returns for that factor.

Example:
Scenario:
- Country A (Rich): Capital-abundant, specializes in producing machinery (capital-intensive).
- Country B (Poor): Labor-abundant, specializes in producing textiles (labor-intensive).

Before trade:
- In **Country A**, capital earns a return of 10%, and wages are $20 per hour.
- In **Country B**, capital earns a return of 5%, and wages are $5 per hour.

**After trade:**

- **Country A** (Rich) exports machinery and imports textiles. 

The demand for capital in Country A increases because it needs more machinery to export. 

As a result, the return on capital in Country A increases from 10% to 15%. 

However, since the country now imports textiles, the demand for domestic labor falls, and wages drop from $20 per hour to $15 

per hour.

- **Country B** (Poor) exports textiles and imports machinery. 
The demand for labor in Country B increases as more textiles are produced for export, 
causing wages to rise from $5 per hour to $8 per hour. 
However, the return on capital in Country B falls from 5% to 3% because the country imports cheaper 
machinery instead of producing it domestically.

**Distributional Issues:**
- **In Country A (Rich):** Capital owners benefit significantly from trade because their returns increase, 
but workers suffer due to falling wages. This creates income inequality within the country, as the gains 
from trade are not evenly distributed.

- **In Country B (Poor):** Workers benefit from rising wages, but capital owners see a decrease in their returns, 
leading to potential discontent among those who rely on capital income.

### **Key Takeaway:**

The Stolper-Samuelson Theorem highlights that while trade can increase overall economic efficiency (aggregate effect), 
it also has significant distributional consequences. 
The gains from trade are not shared equally within each country, leading to potential inequality. 
This insight is crucial for policymakers, as it underscores the need to address the negative impacts on the groups that 
lose out from trade, such as through retraining programs, social safety nets, or redistributive policies.
